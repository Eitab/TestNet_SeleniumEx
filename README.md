# TestNet_SeleniumEx

In this project, I have resolved two questions using the following classes:

emailReader.java - [Question 1]
[Solution to Question 1]
HtmlTablePage.java - [Question 2]
[Solution to Question 2]
in this class I implemented getTableCellText() and verifyTableCellText() functions
I have also included a test class:

HtmlTablesTest.java - [Description of Test Class]
The test class tests the functionality of the HtmlTablePage class to ensure it is working correctly.
